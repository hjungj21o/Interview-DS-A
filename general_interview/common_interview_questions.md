Tell me about yourself:

    - Have more than 5 years exp in advertising/marketing
        -- 2+ years in political advertising in DC with a firm called Revolution Messaging
        -- 1.5 years at an ad-tech company called Unified, handling enterprise 
            clients like Spotify, Toyota, AT&T, specializing in paid social 
        -- About half a year spent in in-house marketing at Rockets of Awesome, 
            an e-commerce-focused kidswear brand, where I oversaw all growth marketing efforts


    - One common factor = as I grew as a digital marketer, my time with the tech team increased 
        to the point where it felt like I was spending more time in tech meetings than marketing meetings
            -- Conducting A/B tests, placing ads pixels on websites, improving 
                website performance, pulling data to make smarter marketing decisions
            -- Naturally, my curiosity to understand the tech space really compounded 
                as well and finally started my journey to coding 2nd half of last year

    - In January, went to a bootcamp called App Academy where I spent more than 80hr/week to 
        learn technologies like Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, and really jumpstart my software engineering career

    - Currently volunteering my time at a non-profit called The Giving Grape as a software engineer.



What interested you in this role? (Why x company?)
    - Bloomberg: 
        -- First exposure to Bloomberg during a meeting with the media team to discuss ads sales
        -- Didn't think much of it back then but now that I'm a SWE, I realize how much effort it took to build out the ads platform
        -- When I moved to NY, realized almost all bankers and Wall St. friends all talked about the Bloomberg Terminal
            -- If it's so widely used in the industry, I realized how great the product is
        -- When I interviewed Bloomberg SWEs and interviewees alike for their experiences, one common word came up a lot: "collaborative"
            -- Even in interview settings, there's a high level of collaboration. I thrive and learn the most in that setting, so would love to be a part of the org.


Biggest challenge faced so far during coding?
    - Not a project, but during my volunteer experience
        -- For personal projects, I know exactly what I’m going to code and how everything works. 
            The toughest thing was looking at other people’s code and trying to understand what each functions do and how everything is connected  
    - That’s why I believe documentation and clear coding are absolutely crucial, and have been trying to exercise that in my own code


Greatest Strength:

    - Tenacity and ability to pick things up quickly
        -- Picked up many languages and tech stacks in order to be a successful 
            engineer in a matter of 3-4 months and built 4 projects to show for it
        -- When hard problems arise, even if it takes me days or lose sleep over it I’m determined to solve it

    
Weakness:
    - Public speaking and being new to the game
        -- English is my second language and sometimes it is difficult to communicate my thoughts 100%
        -- Before corona, I was attending classes for public speaking
        -- Now, I co-host and produce a podcast to help me think on the fly and speak more naturally as much as i can
